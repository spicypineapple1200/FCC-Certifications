### Task List 

##### Lines 4-23, Time Calculations
###### I origninally wrote this portion of the code using the datetime module. It turned out longer and more complicated than I would have liked so instead I wrote code to calculate the time differences manually. Keeping track of the days passed, keeping track of the "AM" and "PM" changes, and so on. It could be cleaned up a bit more but the functionality turned out fine!

##### Lines 26-36, Day Calculations
###### This portion of the code detects if the variable 'day' is included in the function call. If so, it creates a list of week days and works through some logic to determine which week day we have landed on given however much time has passed. The 'days_passed' variable from the first portion of the code is used here when indexing the list to determine our new week day.

##### Lines 39-40, Problem solved!
###### Returning the final answer. Problem solved!
